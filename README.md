### Hello!

I’m Manav. I love programming. I like building things, big and small, in all
sorts of languages. Over time I have come to know many languages, but almost all
of them are programming languages, I wish I knew more natural languages too,
because I also love writing (as you can probably tell by how I can’t get myself
to stop writing this sentence).

Some of my code is here. I also have a [weird blog / artwork
site](https://mrmr.io), where I write stuff and create lil JS animations and do
experiments with color and music and design.
