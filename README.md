### Hello

I’m Manav. I love programming. I like building things, big and small, in all
sorts of languages. Over time I have come to know many languages, but almost all
of them are programming languages. I wish I knew more natural languages too,
because I also love writing (as you can probably tell by how I can’t get myself
to stop writing this sentence).

Some of my code is here. I also have a [lil website](https://mrmr.io).
